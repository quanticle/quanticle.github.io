</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Above and beyond the specifics of the Russo-Georgian war, the book focuses on and analyzes the probable nature of military operations in the post-Cold War world

<ul>
<li>
Politically, the war pitted the Russian federation, the successor to the Soviet Union against the new Republic of Georgia

<li>
Russia perceived genuinely severe threats to its national security because the dissolution of the Soviet Union deprived it of strategic depth in key areas

<li>
The newly formed Republic of Georgia seemed determined to sieze the territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, without consulting either the inhabitants of those regions or the Russian Federation

<li>
The nature and conduct of the war closely resembles the Arab-Israeli war of 1967

<ul>
<li>
Israel absorbed an Arab first strike, and the counterattacked and routed the Arab states in just six days

<li>
Similarly, Russia absorbed a Georgian first strike, and then routed Georgian forces in just five days

<li>
Just like Israel seized the Golan Heights, the Russians seized Abkhazia and South Ossetia and granted them independence

<li>
Just like the Six-Day War presented a new IDF, capable of taking on the combined strength of its Arab neighbors, the Russo-Georgian war presented a new Russian Army, capable of holding its own against more modern opponents

<div id="Georgian Army Reform Under Saakashvili Prior To The 2008 Five Day War-Brief History of the Georgian Army Since 1991"><h3 id="Brief History of the Georgian Army Since 1991">Brief History of the Georgian Army Since 1991</h3></div>
<ul>
<li>
Georgian Army was born when Georgia was still part of the Soviet Union

<li>
December 20, 1990 -- Georgian authorities announced the formation of a "National Guard"

<li>
April 30, 1991 -- Georgian authorities start recruiting for National Guard

<li>
In the early '90s, the National Guard consisted of volunteers, often with no formal higher military education

<li>
Suffered from lack of training and poor discipline

<li>
Was eventually incorporated into the Ministry of Defense, but that incorporation was still its early stages at the end of the 1992-1993 war in Abkhazia

<li>
Ministry of Defense was created in 1992, well after Georgia's declaration of independence

<li>
11th brigade (1st brigade of the 1st corps) was created in the spring of 1992

<li>
Other formations that took part in the 1992 war with Abkhazia were the 23rd Mechanized Infantry Brigade of the 2nd corps and various law enforcement agencies from the Interior Ministry

<li>
Other (para)military forces fielded by Georgia in 1992 were:

<ul>
<li>
Non-governmental paramilitary formations (most notably the Mkhedrioni militia)

<li>
Zviadi militia, loyal to Georgia's deposed first president Zviad Gamaskhurdia

<li>
These forces had even greater problems with indiscipline than the Georgian military

<li>
Zviadi militia actually staged a mutiny against the Georgian military in the last days of the defense of Sukhumi

</ul>
<li>
The Georgian military, during the 1992 Abkhazian war, suffered from lack of unified military command, which prevented it from being able to concentrate forces where they were needed

<li>
Also suffered from indisciplined commanders, who were more eager to find glory than follow orders

<li>
After the initial defeat in Abkhazia, the Georgian state stepped up the reform of its military

<ul>
<li>
Brought paramilitary groups to heel

<li>
Zviadi loyalists were crushed

<li>
Mkhedrioni militia was disbanded

<li>
Other non-govermental militias were brought under (partial) government control

<li>
National Guard's remit was shrunk to that of a reserve training force

</ul>
<li>
The speed of this reform process was held back by a number of limitations

<ul>
<li>
Meager funding

<ul>
<li>
Low pay for officers and enlisted soldiers

<li>
No budget for maintenance or modernization

</ul>
<li>
Pervasive corruption

<li>
Uncertain loyalties of Adjarian leader Aslan Abashidze

</ul>
<li>
However, there were a number of positive changes in the Georgian military and government

<ul>
<li>
Growing foreign military assistance, most notably the United States' 64m dollar Georgia Train and Equip program (GTEP) 

<ul>
<li>
Money was used to train the 1st Infantry Brigade (formerly 11th brigade)

<li>
Also bought training and equipment for a number of other formations

<li>
In addition, GTEP allowed Georgian officers to attend schools and training programs outside of Georgia, allowing them to professionalize

</ul>
<li>
In addition to training and money, the Georgian military also received direct transfers of military equipment from foreign powers

<ul>
<li>
Received 10 UH-1 helicopters from the US

<li>
Received L29 trainer jets from Ukraine

<li>
Received a Project 206MR fast attack missile boat from Ukraine

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
On the whole, the Georgian military had begun to reform and modernize under Shevardnadze, and that process only accelerated under Saakahsvili

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Saakashvili was elected in 2003, and immediately promulgated a number of documents spelling out the priorities for Army reform

<ul>
<li>
National Security Concept

<li>
Threat Assessment Document

<li>
National Military Strategy

<li>
Strategic Defense Review

<li>
Defense Minister's Vision

</ul>
<li>
The National Security Concept outlined the following priorities and challenges:

<ul>
<li>
Priorities:

<ul>
<li>
Territorial integrity

<li>
Stability in the Caucasus and Black Sea region

<li>
Secure a role for Georgia as a transit corridor

</ul>
<li>
Challenges:

<ul>
<li>
Threats to territorial integrity from Abkhazia and South Ossetia

<li>
Spread of armed conflict from the Russian North Caucasus

<li>
Military aggression from other states (considered unlikely) or from non-state actors (considered more likely)

<li>
Terrorist attacks against key infrastructure and locations, such as pipelines and embassies

<li>
Contraband and organized crime

<li>
Short-term threat from Russian bases on Georgian soil, pending their withdrawal

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
The Threat Assessment Document and National Military Strategy contained much the same priorities and challenges

<li>
However the National Military Strategy also highlighted the Russian peacekeepers in Abkhazia and South Ossetia as a potential threat

<li>
By 2007 the completion of Russian withdrawal from military bases in Georgia led a lowering of the assessment of the threat for large scale aggression in the Strategic Defense Review of that year

<li>
The 2007 SDR laid out the following threat picture:

<ul>
<li>
Large-scale aggression against Georgia (unlikely)

<li>
Renewal of hostilities in the breakaway autonomies

<li>
Spread of conflict from the North Caucasus

<li>
Spread of conflict from the South Caucasus

<li>
International terrorism

</ul>
<li>
Military planning was carried out with an eye towards which threats were the most likely and which threats would have the largest impact

<ul>
<li>
From 2007 to 2012, renewal of hostilities in the breakaway autonomies was seen as the most likely threat and large-scale aggression was seen as the most dangerous

<li>
From 2013 to 2015, international terrorism was seen as the most likely threat, and the spread of conflict from the North Caucasus as the most dangerous

<li>
The 2007 SDR anticipated that the conflict over Abkhazia and South Ossetia would have been settled by 2012, and that both provinces would have been reintegrated into Georgia

<li>
Another assumption was the Georgia would have become a NATO member by 2012, making the country safe from large-scale military aggression

</ul>
<li>
Although large-scale aggression from a foreign power (i.e. Russia) was seen as unlikely, preparations for such a scenario were a key part of Georgia's military planning

<li>
In addition, NATO membership was seen as a bulwark against such aggression, as Georgia's ability to fend off such aggression were questionable

<li>
In order to make Georgia more attractive as a NATO member, Georgia wished to integrate with NATO standards and make its military able to fight in NATO missions outside of Georgia

<ul>
<li>
Doing so went against the need for operational self-sufficiency

<li>
The difficulty this contradiction posed was compounded by the limited resources available

<li>
Participation in NATO missions meant that Georgia had to reconfigure its armed forces into a relatively small, professional, lightly armed force

<li>
Sending troops on foreign missions meant diverting resources from other military programs

</ul>
<li>
However, in order to face Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Georgia needed a large force, able to overmatch separatist forces in a classic or counterinsurgency clash

<li>
In addition, preparations for defending against large scale aggression called for a large professional army, lots of heavy weapons, a large and well-trained reserve, and ancillary equipment (such as air-defense systems) that would be superfluous on NATO missions

<li>
As a result, the Georgian military strategy called for its army to be able to fight both conventionally and unconventionally

<li>
Georgian military strategy called for troops to switch to unconventional warfare as they were overrun, rather than retreat

<ul>
<li>
Small size of country meant that there were few places to retreat to

<li>
Past experience indicated that territory, once lost, was not easily regained

<li>
The best way to deter an adversary was thought to be create a situation which would require high losses for uncertain chances of success

</ul>
<li>
Overall, the National Military Strategy (NMS)
