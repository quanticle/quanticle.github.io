<h2 id="orga1befed">Foreword</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orga1befed">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Anthology of 7 chapters</li>
<li>Details the Russo-Georgian War
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Took place over a period of 5 days in August 2008</li>
<li>First comprehensive account of this short, but vicious war</li>
<li>The Russo-Georgian War defies those who would proclaim an "end of history", and claim that state-on-state conflict is no longer likely after the end of the Cold War</li>
<li>Produced by the Center for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies (CAST)
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Moscow-based think-tank</li>
<li>Presents the Russian perspective on most matters</li>
<li>However, they still clearly address issues such as wartime atrocities, air and missile attacks on civilian targets, and Russian military losses</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Presents an ideal point of departure for future histories of the Russo-Georgian war</li>
<li>Book's contents
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Lead essay describes the development of the Georgian armed forces from the formation of the state of Georgia in 1991 to the conflict in August 2008
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Reveals the nature and perceived intent of Georgia's military modernization program</li>
<li>Assesses the impact of that program on the outcome of the ensuing war</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Second essay: detailed account of the military dimension of the war
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Describes the war's course chronologically</li>
<li>Assess the performance of the contending armies</li>
<li>Highlights controversial issues such as military and civilian losses</li>
<li>Demonstrates the striking continuities in Russian military's force structure from Soviet Union</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Third essay: impact of the war on the Russian and Georgian armed forces
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Emphasizes changes in force structures</li>
<li>Increasing importance of automated command and control</li>
<li>Influence of new types of weaponry</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The next 4 essays cover
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>The nature, causes and effects of Russian aircraft losses during the war</li>
<li>The nature and reasons for the Georgian Army's excessive personnel and equipment losses</li>
<li>Post-war establishment of Russian bases inside Abkhazia and South Ossetia</li>
<li>Russian and Allied losses during the war</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Above and beyond the specifics of the Russo-Georgian war, the book focuses on and analyzes the probable nature of military operations in the post-Cold War world
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Politically, the war pitted the Russian federation, the successor to the Soviet Union against the new Republic of Georgia</li>
<li>Russia perceived genuinely severe threats to its national security because the dissolution of the Soviet Union deprived it of strategic depth in key areas</li>
<li>The newly formed Republic of Georgia seemed determined to sieze the territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, without consulting either the inhabitants of those regions or the Russian Federation</li>
<li>The nature and conduct of the war closely resembles the Arab-Israeli war of 1967
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Israel absorbed an Arab first strike, and the counterattacked and routed the Arab states in just six days</li>
<li>Similarly, Russia absorbed a Georgian first strike, and then routed Georgian forces in just five days</li>
<li>Just like Israel seized the Golan Heights, the Russians seized Abkhazia and South Ossetia and granted them independence</li>
<li>Just like the Six-Day War presented a new IDF, capable of taking on the combined strength of its Arab neighbors, the Russo-Georgian war presented a new Russian Army, capable of holding its own against more modern opponents</li>
</ul></li>

<h3 id="org8596f8d">Brief History of the Georgian Army Since 1991</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8596f8d">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Georgian Army was born when Georgia was still part of the Soviet Union</li>
<li>December 20, 1990 &#x2013; Georgian authorities announced the formation of a "National Guard"</li>
<li>April 30, 1991 &#x2013; Georgian authorities start recruiting for National Guard</li>
<li>In the early '90s, the National Guard consisted of volunteers, often with no formal higher military education</li>
<li>Suffered from lack of training and poor discipline</li>
<li>Was eventually incorporated into the Ministry of Defense, but that incorporation was still its early stages at the end of the 1992-1993 war in Abkhazia</li>
<li>Ministry of Defense was created in 1992, well after Georgia's declaration of independence</li>
<li>11th brigade (1st brigade of the 1st corps) was created in the spring of 1992</li>
<li>Other formations that took part in the 1992 war with Abkhazia were the 23rd Mechanized Infantry Brigade of the 2nd corps and various law enforcement agencies from the Interior Ministry</li>
<li>Other (para)military forces fielded by Georgia in 1992 were:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Non-governmental paramilitary formations (most notably the Mkhedrioni militia)</li>
<li>Zviadi militia, loyal to Georgia's deposed first president Zviad Gamaskhurdia</li>
<li>These forces had even greater problems with indiscipline than the Georgian military</li>
<li>Zviadi militia actually staged a mutiny against the Georgian military in the last days of the defense of Sukhumi</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Georgian military, during the 1992 Abkhazian war, suffered from lack of unified military command, which prevented it from being able to concentrate forces where they were needed</li>
<li>Also suffered from indisciplined commanders, who were more eager to find glory than follow orders</li>
<li>After the initial defeat in Abkhazia, the Georgian state stepped up the reform of its military
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Brought paramilitary groups to heel</li>
<li>Zviadi loyalists were crushed</li>
<li>Mkhedrioni militia was disbanded</li>
<li>Other non-govermental militias were brought under (partial) government control</li>
<li>National Guard's remit was shrunk to that of a reserve training force</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The speed of this reform process was held back by a number of limitations
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Meager funding
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Low pay for officers and enlisted soldiers</li>
<li>No budget for maintenance or modernization</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Pervasive corruption</li>
<li>Uncertain loyalties of Adjarian leader Aslan Abashidze</li>
</ul></li>
<li>However, there were a number of positive changes in the Georgian military and government
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Growing foreign military assistance, most notably the United States' 64m dollar Georgia Train and Equip program (GTEP) 
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Money was used to train the 1st Infantry Brigade (formerly 11th brigade)</li>
<li>Also bought training and equipment for a number of other formations</li>
<li>In addition, GTEP allowed Georgian officers to attend schools and training programs outside of Georgia, allowing them to professionalize</li>
</ul></li>
<li>In addition to training and money, the Georgian military also received direct transfers of military equipment from foreign powers
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Received 10 UH-1 helicopters from the US</li>
<li>Received L29 trainer jets from Ukraine</li>
<li>Received a Project 206MR fast attack missile boat from Ukraine</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>On the whole, the Georgian military had begun to reform and modernize under Shevardnadze, and that process only accelerated under Saakahsvili</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="org8f05245">Georgian Army Priorities Under Saakashvili</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org8f05245">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Saakashvili was elected in 2003, and immediately promulgated a number of documents spelling out the priorities for Army reform
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>National Security Concept</li>
<li>Threat Assessment Document</li>
<li>National Military Strategy</li>
<li>Strategic Defense Review</li>
<li>Defense Minister's Vision</li>
</ul></li>
<li>The National Security Concept outlined the following priorities and challenges:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Priorities:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Territorial integrity</li>
<li>Stability in the Caucasus and Black Sea region</li>
<li>Secure a role for Georgia as a transit corridor</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Challenges:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Threats to territorial integrity from Abkhazia and South Ossetia</li>
<li>Spread of armed conflict from the Russian North Caucasus</li>
<li>Military aggression from other states (considered unlikely) or from non-state actors (considered more likely)</li>
<li>Terrorist attacks against key infrastructure and locations, such as pipelines and embassies</li>
<li>Contraband and organized crime</li>
<li>Short-term threat from Russian bases on Georgian soil, pending their withdrawal</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Threat Assessment Document and National Military Strategy contained much the same priorities and challenges</li>
<li>However the National Military Strategy also highlighted the Russian peacekeepers in Abkhazia and South Ossetia as a potential threat</li>
<li>By 2007 the completion of Russian withdrawal from military bases in Georgia led a lowering of the assessment of the threat for large scale aggression in the Strategic Defense Review of that year</li>
<li>The 2007 SDR laid out the following threat picture:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Large-scale aggression against Georgia (unlikely)</li>
<li>Renewal of hostilities in the breakaway autonomies</li>
<li>Spread of conflict from the North Caucasus</li>
<li>Spread of conflict from the South Caucasus</li>
<li>International terrorism</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Military planning was carried out with an eye towards which threats were the most likely and which threats would have the largest impact
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>From 2007 to 2012, renewal of hostilities in the breakaway autonomies was seen as the most likely threat and large-scale aggression was seen as the most dangerous</li>
<li>From 2013 to 2015, international terrorism was seen as the most likely threat, and the spread of conflict from the North Caucasus as the most dangerous</li>
<li>The 2007 SDR anticipated that the conflict over Abkhazia and South Ossetia would have been settled by 2012, and that both provinces would have been reintegrated into Georgia</li>
<li>Another assumption was the Georgia would have become a NATO member by 2012, making the country safe from large-scale military aggression</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Although large-scale aggression from a foreign power (i.e. Russia) was seen as unlikely, preparations for such a scenario were a key part of Georgia's military planning</li>
<li>In addition, NATO membership was seen as a bulwark against such aggression, as Georgia's ability to fend off such aggression were questionable</li>
<li>In order to make Georgia more attractive as a NATO member, Georgia wished to integrate with NATO standards and make its military able to fight in NATO missions outside of Georgia
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Doing so went against the need for operational self-sufficiency</li>
<li>The difficulty this contradiction posed was compounded by the limited resources available</li>
<li>Participation in NATO missions meant that Georgia had to reconfigure its armed forces into a relatively small, professional, lightly armed force</li>
<li>Sending troops on foreign missions meant diverting resources from other military programs</li>
</ul></li>
<li>However, in order to face Abkhazia and South Ossetia, Georgia needed a large force, able to overmatch separatist forces in a classic or counterinsurgency clash</li>
<li>In addition, preparations for defending against large scale aggression called for a large professional army, lots of heavy weapons, a large and well-trained reserve, and ancillary equipment (such as air-defense systems) that would be superfluous on NATO missions</li>
<li>As a result, the Georgian military strategy called for its army to be able to fight both conventionally and unconventionally</li>
<li>Georgian military strategy called for troops to switch to unconventional warfare as they were overrun, rather than retreat
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Small size of country meant that there were few places to retreat to</li>
<li>Past experience indicated that territory, once lost, was not easily regained</li>
<li>The best way to deter an adversary was thought to be create a situation which would require high losses for uncertain chances of success</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Overall, the National Military Strategy (NMS)</li>
