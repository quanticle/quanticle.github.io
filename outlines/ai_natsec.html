<div id="Executive Summary"><h2 id="Executive Summary">Executive Summary</h2></div>
<ul>
<li>
AI research has demonstrated much more progress than anticipated over the past 5 years

<ul>
<li>
Most of this progress has been due to machine learning

<li>
Experts anticipate that this progress will continue, or even accelerate

</ul>
<li>
Most AI research advances are occurring in academia or the private sector

<ul>
<li>
Private sector funding for AI research dwarfs the US government's spending

</ul>
<li>
Existing capabilities in AI have significant potential for national security

<li>
Future AI progress has the potential to be a transformative national security technology, on par with nuclear weapons, aircraft, computers and biotech

<li>
Advances in AI will affect national security by driving change in: military superiority, information superiority and economic superiority

<ul>
<li>
Military superiority: AI will create new capabilities and make existing capabilities more affordable

<ul>
<li>
Commercially available AI technology may give weak states and non-state actors access to long-range precision strike capabilities

<li>
Activities that currently require lots of high-skill labor (such as Advanced Persistent Threat operations) may be automated, packaged and sold on the black market

</ul>
<li>
Information superiority: AI will enhance the collection, analysis and creation of data

<ul>
<li>
More sources from which to determine truth

<li>
Easier to craft persuasive lies

<li>
AI enhanced forgeries will erode the basis of trust of many institutions

</ul>
<li>
Economic superiority: AI could drive a new industrial revolution

<ul>
<li>
Dramatic decline in demand for labor -- might lead to up to a "third of all men between the ages of 25 and 54 being unemployed"

<li>
This will reshape the relationship between labor and capital

<li>
Growing automation could create a "resource curse" scenario for developed countries

<li>
Population size will become less important for national power -- small countries with highly developed AI infrastructure will punch far above their weight

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
"Lessons learned" from four prior transformative military technologies: nuclear, aerospace, cyber, biotech

<ul>
<li>
Radical technological change begets radical government policy ideas

<ul>
<li>
National security implications of AI will be "revolutionary", not "different"

<ul>
<li>
<em>What's the difference between "different" and "revolutionary"?</em>

</ul>
<li>
Governments will consider and implement radical policy measures, perhaps as radical as in the early days of nuclear weapons

<ul>
<li>
<em>What radical policy measures did governments adopt in the early days of nuclear weapons?</em>

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Arms races are unavoidable, but they can be managed

<ul>
<li>
In 1899 nations voluntarily agreed to a treaty banning the use of weaponized aircraft

<li>
This treaty was quickly abandoned in World War 1, as the advantages of aerial bombardment proved irresistible

<li>
The report's authors predict something similar for artificial intelligence -- whatever treaties or agreements we have restricting or banning the use of AI in warfare will be quickly abandoned if and when an actual war breaks out

<li>
Instead, we should pursue goals of keeping AI "safe"

</ul>
<li>
Government must both promote and restrain commercial activity

<ul>
<li>
Government must recognize the inherent dual-use nature of technology 

<ul>
<li>
British government sold the Soviet Union 45 copies of the Rolls Royce 'Nene' jet engine

<li>
Soviet Union reverse engineered this engine and turned it into the Klimov VK-1 which powered the MiG-15

</ul>
<li>
The US has a huge advantage in private sector and academic AI research

<li>
However, the relationship between private sector, academia and the government is fraught with tension

</ul>
<li>
Governments must formalize goals for technology safety and provide adequate resources

<ul>
<li>
In all cases studied, safety outcomes improved when governments created formal organizations tasked with improving the safety of their technology domains

<li>
Organizations must have the necessary resources (human resources, money, time and political capital)

<li>
US should stand up a formal organization tasked with investigating and promoting AI safety across the entire government and commercial AI portfolio

</ul>
<li>
As technology changes, so does the US's national interest

<ul>
<li>
Declining cost and complexity of bioweapons led US to change its strategy from aggressive development to voluntary restraint

<li>
US has a strategic interest in shaping the cost, complexity and offense/defense balance of national security technologies

<li>
As with stealth aircraft, targeted investments can allow the US to affect the offense/defense balance and build a long-lasting technological edge

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
3 goals and 11 recommendations for US national security policy with regards to AI

<ul>
<li>
Goal: Preserve US technological leadership

<ul>
<li>
DoD should conduct AI-focused war games in order to identify potential disruptive military innovations

<li>
DoD should fund long-term strategic analyses of AI technology

<li>
Prioritize AI R&amp;D spending in areas that can provide sustainable advantages and mitigate key risks

<li>
Invest heavily in "counter-AI" capabilities for both offense and defense

</ul>
<li>
Goal: Support peaceful use of technology

<ul>
<li>
DARPA, IARPA, et. al. should be given increased funding for AI related basic research

<li>
Department of Defense should release a request for information on dual-use AI technologies

<li>
In-Q-Tel should be given additional resources to promote collaboration between the national security community and the commercial AI industry

</ul>
<li>
Goal: Manage catastrophic risks

<ul>
<li>
The National Security Council, the Defense Department and the State Department should study what AI applications the US should seek to restrict with treaties

<li>
The Defense Department and the Intelligence Community should establish dedicated AI safety organizations

<li>
DARPA should fund research on fail-safe and safety-for-performance technology for AI systems

<li>
NIST and the NSA should explore options for countering AI-enabled forgery

</ul>
</ul>
</ul>

<li>
Increased availability of large data sets upon which to train large machine learning systems

<li>
