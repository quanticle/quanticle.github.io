<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1c5304b">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Bruce Jones:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For the past two decades, governments and observers have paid more attention to nuclear non-proliferation than to the more traditional concerns of deterrence, strategic stability and arms control</li>
<li>These concerns are once again coming to the forefront with the new era of great-power competition</li>
<li>Discuss the intersection of strategic stability and non-proliferation &#x2013; these two concerns don't always align</li>
<li>Discuss whether the US government is well-positioned to handle contemporary challenges posed by nuclear weapons</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Frank Rose:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>For the past 25 years, our nuclear policy has been about reducing the number of nuclear weapons</li>
<li>We are now probably at the end of that process and we won't be talking about reductions for some time</li>
<li>How do we manage great power competition with Russia and China</li>
<li>Nuclear deterrence is necessarily a part of this competition</li>
<li>Nuclear modernization is a components of deterrence</li>
<li>Keep in mind the <i>real goal</i> of arms control: prevent nuclear war</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Strobe Talbott:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Examine deterrence and arms control together</li>
<li>"Classical" approaches to arms control are obsolete</li>
<li>Evolution of Russia's strategy has made the old discussions around arms control obsolete</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Robert Einhorn:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Stability has to take priority over reductions</li>
<li>Prevailing framework is out of date
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Prevailing framework was focused on bilateral deals between the USA and the USSR</li>
<li>Provide for equal numbers of nuclear weapons on equal numbers of 3 types of delivery vehicles:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>ICBMs</li>
<li>Land-based missiles</li>
<li>Strategic bombers</li>
<li><i>Surprised that he doesn't mention submarine launched missiles, but perhaps that's because submarine-launched missiles weren't subject to arms control treaties?</i></li>
<li><i>Submarine-launched missiles <b>are</b> covered by arms control treaties, both directly and as a result of limitations on numbers of warheads and delivery systems</i></li>
<li><i>Maybe he misspoke, and meant submarine-based missiles instead of land-based missiles</i></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>2 things have made this old framework obsolete
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Emergence of China as a near-peer great-power competitor</li>
<li>Advent of new offensive and defensive systems
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Missile defenses</li>
<li>Long-range high-precision conventional strike systems</li>
<li>Anti-space systems</li>
<li>Cyber-warfare</li>
</ul></li>
<li><i>Adversaries now have credible <b>non-nuclear</b> ways to cripple their enemy's ability to launch a retaliatory counterstrike</i></li>
</ul></li>
<li>We need to think about many more variables when considering arms control and strategic stability</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Madelyn Creedon:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Some of this is due to natural forces of economics and politics</li>
<li>At the end of the Cold War, it was clear that neither the US nor Russia <b>needed</b> as many nuclear weapons as they had</li>
<li>Russia's dire economic straits created an opportunity where Russia was willing to negotiate arms reduction
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>They gained directly by having fewer weapons to maintain, which was an important concern, given how many weapons they had and how much maintenance nuclear weapons need</i></li>
</ul></li>
<li>US, meanwhile, was focused on terrorism rather than great power conflict
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Allowed the US government a freer hand on negotiating arms control because the US public and US politicians were more focused on the threat posed by transnational terrorism &#x2013; didn't seem as important for the US to maintain an unassailable lead in nuclear weapons</i></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The new environment is a result of states wanting better, not necessarily more, nuclear capability
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Russia needed a credible nuclear arsenal in order to be taken seriously as a world power, and it began to modernize its weapons as soon as it had the money to do so</li>
<li>United States had a series of unfortunate incidents which brought to light how badly its nuclear arsenal had deteriorated in the post-Cold War era</li>
<li>China needed a more credible nuclear deterrent in order to exert more influence in its region
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Remember, unlike the US, China has <b>two</b> nuclear states bordering it: India and Russia</i></li>
<li><i>The US nuclear arsenal would get a lot more attention too, if:</i>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li><i>Canada and Mexico were both nuclear armed powers</i></li>
<li><i>They had expansionary geopolitical ambitions of their own</i></li>
</ol></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>We need to worry about the qualitative capabilities of nuclear weapons, not just absolute numbers (<i>like "throw weight", or numbers of delivery vehicles</i>)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Frank Rose:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Thomas Schelling, in the '60s, wrote about how the "character" of weapons mattered, in addition to the numbers of weapons</li>
<li>We can no longer used the "two-states/one-weapon" paradigm when discussing arms control
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Two states: US and USSR</i></li>
<li><i>One weapon: ICBMs</i></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Today, we need to think about not just the US-Russia relationship, but the US-China relationship, the Russia-China relationship, the India-Pakistan relationship&#x2026;</li>
<li>Meanwhile, the introduction of new technology means that we can't discuss arms control solely in terms of a single weapons system</li>
<li><i>Can't just talk about how many ICBMs we have vs. how many they have</i></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org93a6289">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Bruce Jones: Given Russia's modernization and its threats to explicitly use nuclear weapons, how should the US approach the bilateral nuclear relationship with Russia?</li>
<li>Michael O'Hanlon:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Nuclear stability depends on great-power stability</li>
<li>The only way that nuclear weapons become safe is if the great powers outline which domains they're going to compete in and which domains are off limits</li>
<li>Russia's nuclear threats are in service of other goals</li>
<li>The Russian government is not interested in pursuing a nuclear stability strategy for its own sake</li>
<li>They're willing to violate arms control treaties if they think it will serve their broader strategic objectives</li>
<li>It is a mistake to think that everyone is after nuclear stability</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Frank Rose:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Nuclear weapons are critical to Russian geopolitical strategy</li>
<li>Russia has no real allies, other than maybe Syria and Belarus</li>
<li>Demographic challenges</li>
<li>Economy that is still dangerously dependent on commodities and resource extraction</li>
<li>While they have modernized their military to some extent, their military still lags far behind the US, especially in its ability to operate globally
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>For example, look at all the problems they had with their sole aircraft carrier when they attempted to perform combat operations in Syria</i></li>
<li><i>There were so many issues that the airplanes were transferred to a land base, and the carrier sailed back to Russia, empty</i></li>
<li><i>Meanwhile the US routinely conducts combat operations from two or three carriers at the same time</i></li>
</ul></li>
<li>The Russian "strategic partnership" with China is solely about balancing the US</li>
<li>Nuclear weapons are the only thing where the Russians can credibly claim that they are the equals of the US</li>
<li>What are the geopolitical implications for the US?
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Russia does not believe that the European security infrastructure that was built up in the '80s and the '90s is in its interest</li>
<li>View that arms controls treaties were imposed upon Russia when it was weak</li>
<li><i>Shades of German dissatisfaction with the Treaty of Versailles</i></li>
<li>Russia has a different view of bilateral nuclear treaties than the US
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Treaties are about ensuring that they maintain parity with the US</li>
<li>What the treaty bans and does not ban gives Russia insight into our nuclear strategy and our technological capabilities</li>
<li><i>Anecdote time:</i>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li><i>Payne, in <span class="underline">The Great American Gamble</span>, talks about how the Russians were absolutely baffled when the US proposed ABM treaty banning missile defense research</i></li>
<li><i>The Russians considered US missile defense capabilities to far superior to their own, and could not understand why the US would throw away the possibility of a decisive strategic advantage</i></li>
<li><i>Of course, that didn't stop them from signing the ABM treaty</i></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bruce Jones: What role does Russia play in the North Korean and Iranian proliferation efforts?</li>
<li>Madelyn Creedon:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>With regards to North Korea, Russia plays a disruptive role</li>
<li>Not viewed as a major player by Pyongyang</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Suzanne Maloney:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>With regards to Iran, it's the US that's the disruptor</li>
<li>Russia played a crucial role in negotiating the JCPOA and continued to participate productively in those negotiations even as US-Russia relations deteriorated elsewhere</li>
<li>It is in Russia's interest to appear to be the more reliable partner after the US walked away from the JCPOA deal
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Deepen ties with both Iran and Syria</li>
<li>Simultaneously benefit from higher oil prices due to reductions in Iranian exports due to US sanctions</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Robert Einhorn:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Russia genuinely does not want Iran to have nuclear weapons</li>
<li>Russia also has a commercial interest in being able to sell nuclear reactors and fuel to Iran</li>
<li>The US and Russia have a common interest with regards to Iranian nuclear capability</li>
<li>While we cannot currently act on those interests, we will need to do so in the future to discourage Iran from pursuing nuclear weapons</li>

<h3 id="orgf53cb70">The China Challenge</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgf53cb70">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Bruce Jones: China is also seeking to change the world order to its benefit, but in a very different way than Russia. Where do nuclear weapons fit into Chinese thinking?</li>
<li>Frank Rose:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>China presents a fundamentally different nuclear challenge</li>
<li>Russia has been very belligerent with its nuclear policy</li>
<li>China continues to maintain a no-first-use policy</li>
<li>Restrained nuclear rhetoric</li>
<li>Aren't trying to match US or Russian arsenals</li>
<li>China's primary priority is to maintain a survivable second-strike capability</li>
<li>To this end, they see US missile defense initiatives as an existential threat to their nuclear deterrent capability</li>
<li>The main concern with China is their offensive anti-satellite and cyberwarfare capabilities</li>
<li>We have a (fraying) dialogue with Russia on cyber and ASAT</li>
<li>We need to start a similar dialogue with China</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Michael O'Hanlon
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>It's a mistake to treat Russia and China similarly when it comes to nuclear policy</li>
<li>Russia is far more reckless than China &#x2013; Russia knows that its power is on the wane, long term</li>
<li>China, on the other hand, is more confident &#x2013; it knows that its conventional capabilities are on the rise</li>
<li>We should be more grateful that China hasn't been more belligerent with their nuclear policy</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Strobe Talbott
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>China has been a beneficiary of globalization</li>
<li>They see it in their best interest to maintain a peaceful world order</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Michael O'Hanlon
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Russia is much more willing to overturn international norms</li>
<li>China wants to be seen as an equal, but it is willing to work within existing institutions and structures</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bruce Jones:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>China and Russia are playing complementary strategies</li>
<li>While China may not condone what Russia is doing, it benefits from Russia's disruptiveness
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Distracts the US</li>
<li>Weakens Europe</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Main risk for China is that Russia will go too far and will cause a breakdown in the world order which will harm China</li>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Bruce Jones: What impact does cyberwarfare have on nuclear strategy?</li>
<li>Frank Rose
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Cyberwarfare fundamentally changes the nuclear threat landscape</li>
<li>We need to keep the potential for cyber-attack as we modernize our nuclear command and control systems</li>
<li>Strategic capabilities (nuclear, cyberwarfare, artificial intelligence, missile defense, space-borne weapons) are increasingly becoming integrated</li>
<li>One of the mistakes that the Obama administration was that it eliminated the position of Undersecretary of Defense for global strategic affairs</li>
<li>Russia and China most definitely do not consider nuclear, cyber and space as separate &#x2013; why should we?</li>
<li>Unlikely that future conflict will be limited to a single domain</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bruce Jones: Could cyber operations be met with a nuclear response?</li>
<li>Frank Rose
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>No, there is no cyber-attack which would merit a nuclear response</li>
<li>More generally, we need to be more careful about threatening a nuclear response</li>
<li>Given that we're not going to use nuclear weapons to respond to a cyber-attack, we need to formulate credible cyber and conventional responses which can be used to meet a cyber-attack</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Michael O'Hanlon
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>If a cyber-attack, biological weapon or artificial intelligence caused as much damage as a nuclear strike, then we should be open to using nuclear weapons in response</li>
<li>Taking nuclear weapons off the table prematurely ties our hands</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Madelyn Creedon
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>We need to maintain some level of ambiguity in our response</li>
<li>In the near term, however, the main danger is theft of intellectual property</li>
<li>Even the most severe cyber-attacks perpetrated by Russia have been relatively minor things</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Strobe Talbot: We can't count on cyber-attacks remaining mild</li>
<li>Madelyn Creedon
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Need to better protect military and critical assets against cyberattack</li>
<li>Maintain flexibility in response (be it conventional, cyber, or nuclear)</li>
<li>Response should depend on the consequences of the attack, not the nature of the attack</li>
<li>Cyberwarfare is part of a strategic whole</li>
<li>Need to figure out how we can achieve strategic stability in a world with advanced cyberwarfare capabilities and artificial intelligence</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Frank Rose
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Need to improve our ability to adopt and adapt new technology</li>
<li>Plans need to be flexible so that our modernization programs can pick up new technologies as they become available</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Bruce Jones: Should we worry about a medium or longer term future where nuclear launches are automated?</li>
<li>Frank Rose:
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>China, Russia and other authoritarian countries don't have the same qualms about AI that we do</li>
<li>Need to come up with guidelines about launch automation that everyone agrees to stick to for the collective good</li>
<li>It will be difficult to get a formal treaty restricting AI in nuclear weapons so long as nations think the technology can be used for strategic advantage</li>
</ul></li>
